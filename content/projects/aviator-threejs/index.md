Since I've always been interested in game development, I tend to use it as motivation to teach myself new things.
This project details my dive into Three.Js and WebGL to create a simple infite flying game.

## Backgound
While doing some research for my thesis project, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Varendraaa/Shadow), I came across [Karim Maaloul's tutorial](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/) on animating a basic 3D scene using Three.js.

My Javascript skills were a bit rusty at this point, but I was very familiar with OpenGL and diving into Three.Js, a Javascript library that enables easier functionality for WebGL, seemed easy enough.
